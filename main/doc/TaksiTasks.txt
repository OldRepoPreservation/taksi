Taksi Dev Notes
6/6/2006

OPEN QUESTIONS:
why use HeapAlloc instead of new for allocs ? seems the same to me.
dummy keyboard to keep dll loaded ?

KNOWN BUGS:
Half sized GDI not work.
Non Frame GDI not working.
Odd flash when switching DX applcations. must change focus 2 times ?
GDI indicator drawn over overlapped windows. bleeds through.
Data recorded stat number not including overhead! too small.
Should prefer graphics hook over GDI hook. 

TODO:
Comment tag inside AVI file. TAKSI vX date
Need message saying there is no codec selected!
Need message explaining focus changing.
Adjust size of the background thread Q
Manual.txt completely out of date!
Audio
Pause live record ?
Better frame rate calculation ?
Graphics Mode Text overlay - display frame rate/ Megs of data written as text on live window
Context sensative help file.
put debuglog files in the capture dir ?
render the mouse cursor in graphics modes.

Suggest codecs appropriate to desired CPU usage. MSMpeg4 seems good.
Can we use the DirectX JPEG/PNG compressor for screen shots ??
AVI may not be the best format. has too much overhead. is MPG or WMV better ?

smaller AVI index ?
reflect state in tooltip ?
tray icon menu
context/sys menu to take actions.
add a watermark or logo ?

AUDIO TASK:
Get audio from WaveIn (assumes loopback) ? (much easier)
Compress and write audio frames to the AVI file.
Hook Audio stream from output?
 Capture of audio is quite complex unless there is already a loopback in place on the hardware.
 Without a loopback input the output must be hooked at a very low (kernel) level.
 Hook audio output (Wave,DirectSound) device at kernel level
