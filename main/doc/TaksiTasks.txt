Taksi Dev Notes
6/6/2006

OPEN QUESTIONS:
why use HeapAlloc instead of new for allocs ? seems the same to me.
dummy keyboard to keep dll loaded ?
i dont understand the point of frameweight ? how is it different from FrameRate ?

KNOWN BUGS:
Non Frame GDI not working properly.
Some Codecs MUST have mult of 4 input even tho they dont fail. MSMPEG4
switching hook not always working correctly. 2 instances of the same app?
GDI indicator drawn over overlapped windows. bleeds through.
Data recorded stat number not including overhead! too small.

TODO:
hotKeys indicated in the shell icon
check the save dir existis at start up.
AVI doesnt understand < 1 FPS ??
Prompt for selection of codec first time starting app.
Support auto switch to alternate codec if codec fails ?
Should auto prefer graphics hook over GDI hook. 
crc diff uncompressed frames with last. compress to empty frame.
Need message explaining focus changing/hooking.
Allow adjust of the size of the background thread Q
makefile, Manual.txt completely out of date!
Audio
Better frame rate calculation ?
Graphics Mode Text overlay - display frame rate/ Megs of data written as text on live window
Context sensative help file.
put debuglog files in the capture dir ?
render the mouse cursor in graphics modes.
Support DirectShow plugin codec to get Theora support

TEST- hook callbacks might not be on the same thread?
Comment tag inside AVI file. TAKSI vX date + user comments?
Suggest codecs appropriate to desired CPU usage. MSMpeg4v3 seems good.
Can we use the DirectX JPEG/PNG compressor for screen shots ??
AVI may not be the best format. has too much overhead. is MPG or WMV better ?
http://guru.multimedia.cx/category/container-formats/
smaller AVI index ? only index every nth frame or an index every 10 seconds ?
reflect state in tooltip ?
add a watermark or logo ?
color reduction for GDI. reduce to a smaller number of colors ?

AUDIO TASK:
Get audio from WaveIn (assumes loopback) ? (much easier)
Compress and write audio frames to the AVI file.
Hook Audio stream from output?
 Capture of audio is quite complex unless there is already a loopback in place on the hardware.
 Without a loopback input the output must be hooked at a very low (kernel) level.
 Hook audio output (Wave,DirectSound) device at kernel level

Does Windows Media Encoder record audio? How do others do it? hooked WaveOut ?
