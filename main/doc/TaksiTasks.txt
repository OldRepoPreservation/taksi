Taksi Dev Notes
6/6/2006

OPEN QUESTIONS:
why use HeapAlloc instead of new for allocs ? seems the same to me.
dummy keyboard to keep dll loaded ?

BUGS:
App Hook switch not always correct. TEST switch between 2 GDI apps, 2 DX apps.
GUI indicator drawn over overlapped windows. bleeds through.
Data recorded stat number not including overhead!
Fix logging of messages to 'Taksi_App.log' file.

TODO:
Manual.txt completely out of date!
Background thread queue N raw frames for compression.
Option to hook GDI or not.
Audio
Pause live record ?
Better frame rate calculation ?
Graphics Mode Text overlay - display frame rate/ Megs of data written as text on live window
Context sensative help file.
Move debug flag to Gui such that logs are turned on on demand?

Suggest codecs appropriate to desired CPU usage. MSMpeg4 seems good.
Can we use the DirectX JPEG/PNG compressor for screen shots ??
AVI may not be the best format. has too much overhead. is MPG or WMV better ?

smaller AVI index ?
reflect state in tooltip ?
tray icon menu
context/sys menu to take actions.

AUDIO TASK:
Get audio from WaveIn (assumes loopback) ? (much easier)
Compress and write audio frames to the AVI file.
Hook Audio stream from output?
 Capture of audio is quite complex unless there is already a loopback in place on the hardware.
 Without a loopback input the output must be hooked at a very low (kernel) level.
 Hook audio output (Wave,DirectSound) device at kernel level
